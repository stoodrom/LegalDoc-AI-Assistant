# LEGALDOC AI ASSISTANT

## Overview

This is a Generative AI-based legal assistant platform that enables attorneys to generate court-ready legal documents, suggest detailed legal arguments with citations, and interact through a contextual legal Q&A chatbot. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and integrates trusted U.S. legal databases to provide accurate and actionable legal outputs.

## Features

- Case type workflows: Civil and Criminal  
- Role-based views: Plaintiff Lawyer, Defendant Lawyer, Prosecution, Criminal Defendant  
- Auto-generation of legal documents: plaint, summons, answers, counterclaims, statement of facts, client statements  
- Upload support for evidence, identification documents, witness statements  
- Suggestion engine for legal arguments using FAISS + OpenAI  
- RAG-based legal Q&A with fallback to official legal resources  
- Citation of relevant laws and acts when applicable  
- Sidebar notes for each role  
- Local vector database to enable fast retrieval  

## Architecture and Tools Used

- OpenAI GPT-4o for LLM document generation and Q&A  
- LangChain for agent, document tools, and prompt management  
- FAISS for local semantic vector search  
- Google Custom Search API for legal.gov website access  
- Streamlit for UI development  
- Python (backend logic, file handling)  
- Prompt engineering and RAG pipeline construction
