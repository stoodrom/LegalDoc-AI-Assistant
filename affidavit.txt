    AFFIDAVIT OF Witness
    I, Witness, declare under penalty of perjury:
    1. I reside at [Witness Address].
    2. Affidavit

I, Carol White, do solemnly affirm and declare the following:

On January 15, 2025, I was present at Alice Johnson's residence when Bob Smith and Alice Johnson signed a contract for a kitchen renovation. During this interaction, I distinctly heard Bob Smith make a verbal commitment to complete the renovation work by March 15, 2025, for the sum of $10,000.

Subsequently, on March 20, 2025, I revisited Alice Johnson's residence and observed that minimal progress had been made in the kitchen renovation project. Specifically, I noted that only a few cabinets had been installed, and they appeared to be uneven. Furthermore, I overheard Alice Johnson attempting to contact Bob Smith.
